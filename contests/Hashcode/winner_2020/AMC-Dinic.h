	Description: class to represent a new algorithm which is a variation of Dinic
	that tries to solve heuristically a matching problem with a special structure.
	The underlying graph is bipartite and can be seen as tasks and agents. Each
	agent i can perform T_i tasks, and each task j has an associated score S_j.
	We want to maximize the scores of the tasks performed with the contraints that 
	each agent does not develop more than T_i tasks.
	This problem can be solved with minimum-cost maximum flow but it is costly.
	This algorithm is a variation of Dinic with that work as follows.
	First, it create a graph with the following structure:
	- There is a node for each task and agent as well as a source and a sink.
	- Each edge has two features: capacity and priority.
	- The source is joined to each task by creating nodes with capacity one
	and priority the score of the task. The inverted edge that might appear
	in the residual graph has priority equal to the negative of the score.
	- Each task is joined to the agents that can perform that task with
	capacity one and priority equal to the score of the task. The inverted
	edge that might appear in the residual graph has priority equal to the negative
	of the score.
	- Each agent is joined to the sink with capacity equal to the number of
	tasks that be done by the agent and with priority Infinity. The iverted
	edge that might appear in the residual graph has priority equal to minus
	infinity.
	- The list of edges that go out from each node are sorted by the 
	priority. 
	- The Dinic algorithm is applied by considering such an order of the edges
	and considering N phases, where in the phase i, only the edges with an 
	absolute value of the priority larger or equal to 
	(Max_Value) / (i * MaxValue / N)) are taken into account. Note that this
	is somewhat similar to the Dinic approach based on scaling but the 
	activation of edges is made by priority instead of by remaining capacity.
